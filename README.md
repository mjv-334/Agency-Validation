# Agency-Validation
This project is an automated system for verifying agency applications. It uses web scraping, natural language processing, and AI-based evaluation to determine agency eligibility based on predefined criteria.
The system is built using Flask, a headless browser, NLTK, and Gemini AI, and it includes email notifications for status updates.
